# Meetup Event
https://www.meetup.com/NYC-PyLadies/events/259310784/

# Pre-requirements
We expect a working knowledge of Python in order to be able to follow along with the workshop. If you are an absolute beginner in Python and aren't familiar with Python syntax, this workshop might not be suited for you.

# Pre-workshop prep instructions
**We strongly recommend running a virtual environment for this workshop with up-to-date versions of the libraries we use.**

## Step 1: Make sure you are running a recent version of Python
Either Python 2.7.12 and upwards, or any Python 3.

## Step 2: Install the necessary libraries for the workshop
Install these libraries by running `pip install` on your laptop:

**Ideal - the versions I run locally:** 
- Pandas 0.24.x and above
- Seaborn 0.9.x and above
- Matplotlib 3.0.x and above
- Jupyter 1.0.x and above
 
**Works for most of the tutorial:**
- Pandas 0.12.x and above
- Seaborn 0.5.x and above
- Matplotlib 2.1.x and above
- Jupyter 1.0.x and above

## Step 3: Make sure Jupyter Notebook runs
- Run in a terminal: `jupyter notebook`
- This should open a browser window, or go to http://localhost:8888/notebooks/
- Create a new notebook
- Try importing the newly installed libraries in a cell and execute the cell to test
- Please *debug* any issues that occur so you're ready to start the workshop!
